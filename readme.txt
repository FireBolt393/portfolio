So everthing starts off with App.jsx in src folder.
this is imported to main.jsx that runs the App
jsx is a file that has the feature where we can use html and js together without needing to use script tags
it's mainly composed of javascript codes and within we can use html tags
inside html tags, if we wanna use js code, we can simply surround it with {}

we can create reusable piece of code in seperate jsx file that can be imported to app.jsx
For example: Header.jsx, Footer.jsx and Blacklist.jsx

we can import css files using import keyword into whichever jsx file we want

run the following commands to start the App
cd ReactProject
npm run dev
